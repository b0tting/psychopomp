# Psychopomp
A simple Discord bot handling voting for a game. 

Players vote for each other using either a server channel or by directly contacting your bot. On every vote change the bot publishes the current standing of the votes in a given text channel. 

To activate the vote, you @-mention another user in any text channel with the activating expression from the .env file.
